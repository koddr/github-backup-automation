# A [Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/koddr/github-backup-automation) to backup automation for your GitHub accounts (repositories, gists, organizations)

> ☝️ This is a more usable fork of [`umputun/github-backup-docker`](https://github.com/umputun/github-backup-docker) image with some extra features, like gzip compression of your backup files and ready to work with Ansible playbook.

## Usage

I recommend to use this Docker image with Ansible playbook:

- [useful-playbooks/github_backup](https://github.com/truewebartisans/useful-playbooks/blob/master/docs/github_backup.md)

It's a better way to create and deploy container to your remote server with no worries and no manual work.
